--This transaction first selects an available courier with a rating of at least 4.0 who hasn't delivered a transaction in the past 7 days. It then retrieves the amount of the transaction with the given transaction ID and updates the status of the transaction to "Delivered" with the current date and time. Finally, it adds the transaction amount to the balance of the courier's card.

--If there are no available couriers or if any errors occur during the transaction, it will raise an appropriate exception and rollback the changes.
